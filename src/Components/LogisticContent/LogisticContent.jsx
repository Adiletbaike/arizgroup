            Prolog has been operational since the late 1990s, initially
            supporting Central Asia’s mining industry. We enjoy ongoing business
            with clients on a global scale, most specifically in Africa, Central
            Asia, and Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within our ranks, PS&S has more than half a century’s experience in
            worldwide mining supply chain. We have a working knowledge and wide
            experience in all the latest aspects of SCM from demand management
            through to logistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prolog’s founder and managing director is Chris Brodie, who has
            spent a lifetime in mining supply chain and over 20 years providing
            mining supply related activities through his own companies. He now
            looks after Prolog’s Mining Supply Chain Consulting business from
            his dual bases of Telford, UK and Almaty, Kazakhstan.

            Ross Brodie, based at our offices in Telford, UK, was appointed as
            General Manager in 2015 after many years with Prolog Central Asia,
            our supply and consulting branch in Kazakhstan. His wide supply
            knowledge has been invaluable in developing our Procurement &
            Logistics Services business globally.

            Prolog has been operating since the 1990s, initially as an SCM
            consulting firm and has conducted projects globally for many of the
            largest mining companies. In 2005 Prolog focused on equipment,
            equipment spares, and mining consumables supply in the Central Asian
            region, representing large international firms, e.g. ESCO, Oremax,
            GSE.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years Prolog has built strong relationships with select
            manufacturers of steel grinding, Ultra Fine ceramic grinding and
            mining chemicals. We are focused on the Central Asian and Eastern
            European regions; however, we still perform a number of projects
            around the world, particularly in Africa.
          </p>

            Prolog has a diverse team across the world, including a technical
            team in China and freight partners. Our teams in UK, Europe, Central
            Asia and Turkey cover all our internal needs, including a
            metallurgist and SCM specialist. We conduct our business in English,
            Turkish, Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, French, Dutch and Chinese.
